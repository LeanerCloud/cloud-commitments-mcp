// This exists because an empty scope is a DOUBLE-PURCHASE hazard, not merely
// an imprecise audit line. idempotencyKeyFor folds the scope into the token,
// and CredentialScope returns "" when neither the explicit argument nor the
// ambient environment variable is set. The same target account reached two
// ways therefore derives two DIFFERENT tokens:
//
//	omit azure_subscription_id (ambient resolves to sub-X) -> scope ""
//	pass azure_subscription_id="sub-X"                     -> scope "sub-X"
//
// Both purchase into sub-X, but every provider's dedupe is token-keyed --
// Azure's FindReservationOrderByIdempotencyToken, GCP's
// idempotentCommitmentName, and on AWS the EC2/Redshift tag lookups
// (findRIByIdempotencyToken), the RDS/ElastiCache/OpenSearch/MemoryDB
// idempotencyGuard, and Savings Plans' CreateSavingsPlanInput.ClientToken --
// so the second call's lookup misses and buys again. Previewing without the
// account and then re-calling with it explicit is ordinary self-correcting
// model behavior, which makes this a likely sequence rather than a corner
// case.
//
// The fix is to make "" unreachable for a real purchase. Note that explicit
// and ambient do NOT diverge once a value exists: CredentialScope falls back
// to the same environment variable the provider factory itself consults, so
// aws_profile="prod" and an ambient AWS_PROFILE=prod both yield "prod" and
// dedupe correctly. Only the both-absent case aliases, and this closes it.
//
// Deriving the effective account from the resolved client would be the
// stronger fix, but provider.ServiceClient exposes no account accessor
// (pkg/provider/interface.go), so that needs an interface change across every
// AWS/Azure/GCP service client and does not belong on this branch. Failing
// closed removes the hazard by construction in the meantime: on an
// LLM-driven money path, making the operator name the target account before
// spending is the same posture as EnvEnableRealPurchases.

// of silently colliding with an unrelated purchase (issue found in review:
// a $5/hr and $50/hr Compute Savings Plan previously shared a token because
// only HourlyCommitment differed and Details was never consulted). This is a
// request-scoped substitute for the purchase_executions row that the CLI/web
// paths use as their idempotency anchor (pkg/common/tokens.go) -- the MCP
// server has no such row, so the request's own identifying fields play that
// role.

//
// scope (the caller's AWS profile / Azure subscription / GCP project, via
// PurchaseRequest.CredentialScope) is folded in because the product
// dimensions above describe WHAT is bought but not WHERE it lands. Omitting
// it is not merely imprecise, it silently skips real purchases on Azure:
// reservations.FindReservationOrderByIdempotencyToken lists reservation
// orders from the TENANT-wide endpoint (no subscription prefix -- see
// ReservationOrdersListURL), so an identical VM reservation requested for a
// second subscription in the same tenant would match the first
// subscription's order by token, short-circuit, and report success without
// buying anything for the second subscription. AWS (per-account tag/
// ClientToken lookups) and GCP (per-project commitment names) scope their
// own dedupe, so this is defense in depth there and load-bearing on Azure.
//
// This function is deliberately fail-safe with respect to time: it folds in
// no clock reading of any kind. When nonce is empty (the default), two calls
// with identical dimensions ALWAYS derive the same key, no matter how far
// apart in time they happen -- so a retry that straddles any time boundary
// still dedupes at the provider instead of risking a double purchase. An
// earlier version of this function instead folded in an automatic hourly
// time bucket to distinguish "buy 3 RIs now" from a genuinely separate "buy
// 3 more next week" with identical parameters; that inverted the safety
// direction of this money path, because a retry that happened to straddle
// an hour boundary (e.g. a slow request issued at 12:59:58 retried at
// 13:00:02) derived a different key and could double-buy. The worst case of
// the current, fail-safe default is a skipped intentional repeat -- a
// caller who genuinely wants a second, identical purchase must say so
// explicitly. nonce is that explicit opt-in: when the caller supplies a
// non-empty nonce, it is folded into the key so an otherwise-identical
// purchase becomes a distinct one (e.g. "buy 3 now" then "buy 3 more next
// week" by passing a fresh nonce on the second call); the same nonce plus
